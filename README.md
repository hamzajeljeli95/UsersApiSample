<li>The purpose of this project is to understand how Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate and Swagger-UI can really work together.</li>
<li>To deploy this in your testing environment, Just change the connection details in **hibernate.cfg.xml** under **resources** folder and run !</li>
<li>Also, i provided you with the DB Creation script for this project too !</li>
<li>To test the project, run the project and browse to Swagger-UI : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ .</li>
<li>If you are willing to host this demo (somehow ?), make sure to remove the comments from **spring-boot-starter-tomcat** in **pom.xml**.</li>
